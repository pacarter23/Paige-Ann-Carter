This data lists the name of the individuals involved, their role in the posting, and a description of the documents.\nEach individual person and event present in the data set has been assigned a person and event identification number. As my research progresses, the hope is to add to the data set and map what individuals are interacting with one another. This will also help give an idea of what demographic groups were most impacted by these laws."

    "text": "Virginia Tech requires all Master’s students to compile a portfolio that contains three elements: an article length research paper, a history project of the students choice, and a historiography exam based on two book thematic book lists based on the students research interests. To meet these program requirements, I am currently writing two article length papers that examine sexual encounters deemed illicit by North Carolina’s colonial authorities. My portfolio as a whole is entitled Prohibited Paramours, Purposeful Partners: Illicit Sexual Encounters in the Eighteenth Century Borderlands of North Carolina\n\n\nMy first article will highlight white settler groups of North Carolina’s interior, specifically Rowan County. The eighteenth century North Carolina borderlands were diverse, including people of English, Scots-Irish, and German decent. This work will analyze court records from Salisbury District Superior Court, including bastardy bond postings, bastardy cases, and other criminal action papers to determine how women of this area were impacted by the restriction of certain sexual behaviors. The bastardy bond data sets included in this webpage are used to track the postings of such bonds during this period in Rowan County.\n\n\n\nMy second article examines cross-cultural sexual encounters in the borderlands between Indigenous and white partners. This article utilizes sources such as early explorers travel logs, North Carolina’s early legal codes, and personal correspondences to better understand how Indigenous women’s gendered and sexual practices were impacted by settler colonial laws."
